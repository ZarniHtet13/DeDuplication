$\Large\text{probability of linkage}^1 = \sum_{k=1}^n \text{log} \left( \frac{m_k}{u_k} \right)^{\gamma_k^j}\text{log}\left(\frac{1-m_k}{1-u_k}\right)^{1-\gamma_k^j} $


$$
\begin{align*}
j &= \text {record pair in question} \\
k &= \text {identifier (linking variable) in question} \\
n &= \text {number of identifiers per record} \\
m_k &= \text {estimated identifier agreement weight among true links} \\
n_k &= \text {estimated identifier agreement weight among false links} \\
\gamma_k^j &= \text {observed agreement or disagreement (0 or 1) of identifier k in record pair j }
\end{align*}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
